# A Mechanistic Analysis of a Transformer Trained on Symbolic Multi-Step Reasoning Task

#### 1. Dependencies
To install dependencies:
```setup
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

#### 2. Training and Evaluation Code
To train a model from scratch or continue the training, use `training.py`. We provide functions that have been used for evaluation in `src/utils.py`.


#### 3. Pre-trained Model
The model checkpoint we studied in our paper is located in `checkpoint/`. 

#### 4. Replication of Results
We provide a notebook `figures.ipynb` that replicates all figures we report in the paper.
